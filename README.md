# HealthCare Plus - Medical Appointment Scheduling System

HealthCare Plus is a Medical Appointment Scheduling System that allows users to book doctor appointments, manage patient information, handle emergency cases, and process payments. The system provides separate access for doctors and staff to view appointments, manage patients, and maintain medical records.

## 💻 Algorithm Applications
The system implements several algorithms to enhance performance:
1. **Merge Sort** for emergency patient priority sorting
2. **Binary Search** for quick payment record lookup
3. **Greedy Algorithm** for optimal time slot selection
4. **Naive String Matching** for efficient patient/doctor name searches
5. **Dynamic Programming** for appointment scheduling
